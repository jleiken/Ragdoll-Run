# Ragdoll Run

A side-scrolling platformer developed for iOS and iMessage using Apple's Swift and SpriteKit. The project structure should be familiar to anyone who's developed for iOS before. If you have not done so yet, I recommend following Apple's getting started guides before looking over this code.

You can download the final product from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ragdoll-run/id1517876289).
